## Open Questions
- What key metrics should be displayed on the main dashboard?
- What specific market data sources will be used for recommendations?
- What level of customization should be included in user settings initially?
- Should we implement real-time data updates in Phase 2 or defer to Phase 3?

## Active Challenges
- Creating an effective dashboard that balances information density with usability
- Designing a scalable component architecture for dashboard features
- Planning for efficient market data fetching and caching strategies

## Current Sprint
**Sprint 1: Foundation (Wrapping Up)**
