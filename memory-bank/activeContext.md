# Goldex Active Context

## Current Focus
- Preparing for Phase 2 planning (recommendation engine)

## Recent Changes
- Completed the first version of the dashboard, including:
  - Overview tab with prediction card and gold price chart
  - History tab with user prediction history (fetches and displays all predictions made by the logged-in user from Supabase)
  - Alerts tab placeholder
- Created API route for fetching user predictions by ID
- Added PredictionHistory component for displaying user prediction history

## Next Steps
1. **Phase 2 Planning**
   - Plan recommendation engine architecture
   - Research market data providers for integration
   - Design AI-powered analytics features
   - Define subscription tiers and requirements

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Audit and optimize loading times
   - Improve navigation between routes
   - Implement preloading strategies for common paths

3. **Preparation for Deployment**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Configure staging environment
   - Create production environment variables

## Open Questions
- What key metrics should be displayed on the main dashboard?
- What specific market data sources will be used for recommendations?
- What level of customization should be included in user settings initially?
- Should we implement real-time data updates in Phase 2 or defer to Phase 3?

## Active Challenges
- Creating an effective dashboard that balances information density with usability
- Designing a scalable component architecture for dashboard features
- Planning for efficient market data fetching and caching strategies

## Current Sprint
**Sprint 1: Foundation (Completed)**
- Project setup and architecture (Completed)
